# wwww

The wwww stands for: who, what, when, where.

I'm trying to develop standards, and universal methods for referencing "real world people", along with the AI world, and virtual worlds. In the "world of the future" (starting today) it will be helpful to have real time fact checking where people, and AI agents can fact check each other, and gather more facts in real time. 

That's why we need: WHO, WHAT, WHEN, WHERE.

Maybe some future project can tackle WHY.
